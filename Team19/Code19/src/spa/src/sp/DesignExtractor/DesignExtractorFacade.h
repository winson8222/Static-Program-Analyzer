/*
* The DesignExtractorFacade class is responsible for extracting all the design abstractions from the AST.
* It is the main entry point for the Design Extractor component.
* It combined all visitors/extractor class from a higher level logical view where we parse a program
* and extract all the design abstractions through visiting them.
* 
* The following are summary of implementation details
* 
• procedure: extracts Procedure_name, StatementList, Uses, Modifies (to be put on contexts)
• stmtLst: extracts Statement, Read, Assign, Print, Call (put on hold for now), While, If, Follows
• stmt
• read (statement): extracts Read, Variable, Modifies.
• print (statement): extracts Print, Variable, Uses.
• assign (statement): extracts Assign, Variable, Constant, Uses, Modifies, Patterns
• call (statement)  // TODO later
• while (statement): extracts While (line number), Variable, Constant, Uses, Modifies, Parent, Follows
• if (statement): extracts If (line num), Variable, Constant, Uses, Modifies, Parent, Follows
• variable: extracts Variable, Uses, Modifies
• constant: extracts Constant, Uses
