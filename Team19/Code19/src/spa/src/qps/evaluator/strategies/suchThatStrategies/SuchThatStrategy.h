 * @brief Base class for implementing evaluation strategies for "such that" clauses in queries.

 * This class provides a common interface and foundational behavior for all "such that"
 * clauses within the query processing system. Derived classes should implement specific
 * evaluation strategies for different types of "such that" clauses, providing the logic
 * necessary to evaluate those clauses against the program knowledge base.
